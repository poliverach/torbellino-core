# Torbellino Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm init

npm install --save-dev hardhat
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
npm install --save-dev dotenv

npx hardhat

npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run .\scripts\deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
